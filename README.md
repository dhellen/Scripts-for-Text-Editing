Scripts-for-Text-Editing
========================

Basically, if my text editor lacks a feature, I write a script to stand in for it.

Wordcount.py performs a word count for a text file.  If you have Python 2, and it's your default python version, copy the wordcount.py script and place the copy in the same directory as your textfile, then type:
python wordcount.py filename.txt
